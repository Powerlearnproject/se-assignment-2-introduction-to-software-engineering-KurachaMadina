1. Software engineering is a disciplined approach to the design, development, testing, and maintenance of software.

2. While traditional programming focuses on the act of writing code to solve specific problems, software engineering encompasses a broader, more systematic approach to creating software. It includes planning, designing, testing, and maintaining software systems, often involving teamwork and formal methodologies to ensure the software meets quality standards and user requirements.

3. PLANNING in this phase you define the purpose and scope of the project.
   REQUIREMENT in this phase you gather and document user needs and system requiremnts.
   DESIGN in this phase you create ahigh level detailed design of the software architecture and user interface.
   IMPLEMENT in this phase you write code and build softwar according to the design specification.
   TESTING in phase you do testing of your software to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
   DEPLOYMENTS in this phase you release the software to users or customers.
   MAINTENANCE in this you provide ongoing support, update and enhancements to the software after deployment.

4. Waterfall is used for short term projects and agile is used for long term projects.
   Agile is flexible to changes while waterfall rigid structure makes it difficult to accomodate changes.

5. Requirements Engineering (RE) is a systematic and disciplined approach to defining, documenting, and maintaining software requirements. It encompasses a set of activities that help ensure the software meets the needs and expectations of its stakeholders. The process involves eliciting, analyzing, specifying, validating, and managing requirements throughout the software development lifecycle.

6. Modularity in software design is a powerful principle that enhances the maintainability, scalability, and flexibility of software systems. By breaking down complex systems into smaller, self-contained units, modularity promotes better organization, easier management, and more efficient development processes. This approach not only improves the quality of the software but also facilitates collaboration, reuse, and continuous improvement.

7. UNTI TESTING is used to verify that individual units of software function properly.
   INTERGRATION TESTING is used to verify that multiplea units of software work together as expected.
   SYSTEM TESTING is used to Validate the entire integrated software system to ensure it meets the specified requirements.
   ACCEPTANCE TESTING is used to Confirm that the software meets the business requirements and is ready for delivery to the end-users.
      Testing is crucial in software development as it ensures the software's quality, reliability, and performance. Each level of testing plays a specific role in verifying that the software works correctly and meets user requirements, ultimately leading to a successful and dependable software product.

8. Version Control Systems (VCS) are tools that help manage changes to source code over time. They keep track of every modification made to the code in a special kind of database. If a mistake is made, developers can turn back the clock and compare earlier versions of the code to help fix the mistake while minimizing disruption to all team members.There are several popular version control systems for example Git which had distributed feature that is great for collaboration and has hosting service which include Github and Gitlab.

9. Software maintenance is the process of modifying and updating software applications after their initial deployment to correct faults, improve performance, or adapt the software to a changed environment. It ensures that software continues to meet user needs and performs well over time.
    There are different types of maintenance activities including:
        CORRECTIVE MAINTENANCE which fixes bugs anddefects discovered in the software. it involves activities such as debugging.
        ADAPTIVE MAINTENANCE which involves modifying the software to work in a new or changed environment. It normally involves updating the software to be compatible with new hardware or operating systems.
        PERFECTIVE MAINTENANCE which involves Improving or enhancing the software's functionality and performance by adding new features or capabilities based on user requests.
        PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE which make changes to prevent potential future problems.
   Software maintenance is an essential part of the software lifecycle. It involves various activities aimed at fixing issues, adapting the software to new environments, improving performance, and preventing future problems. Through continuous maintenance, software can remain reliable, secure, and relevant, providing long-term value to users and organizations.
10.  Some of the ethical issues that software engineers might face include: Data Privacy and Security, Intellectual Property Rights, Bias and Fairness, Transparency and Accountability, Security Vulnerabilities, Software Quality and Reliability, and User Consent and Autonomy.
They can ensure they adhere to ethical standards by Adopting Ethical Frameworks and Codes of Conduct, Continuous Education and Awareness, Transparent Communication, Incorporating Ethical Considerations in Design,Fostering an Ethical Culture, Secure Development Practices, and Quality Assurance.
