1. Software engineering is a disciplined approach to the design, development, testing, and maintenance of software.

2. While traditional programming focuses on the act of writing code to solve specific problems, software engineering encompasses a broader, more systematic approach to creating software. It includes planning, designing, testing, and maintaining software systems, often involving teamwork and formal methodologies to ensure the software meets quality standards and user requirements.

3. PLANNING in this phase you define the purpose and scope of the project.
   REQUIREMENT in this phase you gather and document user needs and system requiremnts.
   DESIGN in this phase you create ahigh level detailed design of the software architecture and user interface.
   IMPLEMENT in this phase you write code and build softwar according to the design specification.
   TESTING in phase you do testing of your software to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
   DEPLOYMENTS in this phase you release the software to users or customers.
   MAINTENANCE in this you provide ongoing support, update and enhancements to the software after deployment.

4. Waterfall is used for short term projects and agile is used for long term projects.
   Agile is flexible to changes while waterfall rigid structure makes it difficult to accomodate changes.

5. Requirements Engineering (RE) is a systematic and disciplined approach to defining, documenting, and maintaining software requirements. It encompasses a set of activities that help ensure the software meets the needs and expectations of its stakeholders. The process involves eliciting, analyzing, specifying, validating, and managing requirements throughout the software development lifecycle.

6. Modularity in software design is a powerful principle that enhances the maintainability, scalability, and flexibility of software systems. By breaking down complex systems into smaller, self-contained units, modularity promotes better organization, easier management, and more efficient development processes. This approach not only improves the quality of the software but also facilitates collaboration, reuse, and continuous improvement.

7.testing is crucial in software development as it ensures the software's quality, reliability, and performance. Each level of testing plays a specific role in verifying that the software works correctly and meets user requirements, ultimately leading to a successful and dependable software product.
